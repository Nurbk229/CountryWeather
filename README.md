# CountryWeather
Weatherapp is a simple weather forecast app, which uses some APIs to fetch 5 day / 3 hour forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap and to fetch places,cities,counties,coords etc. from Algolia Places. The main goal of this app is to be a sample of how to build an high quality Android application that uses the Architecture components, Dagger etc. in Kotlin.


## Requirements

- Android Studio 4.1.0
- JDK 8
- Android SDK 30
- Supports API Level +21
- Material Components 1.3.0


**Highlights**
- Use [OpenWeatherMap] API
- Use [restcountries] API
- Use [disease] API
- Use [geohub3] API
- Use [flickr] API


**Libraries & Dependencies**
- [Material Design]: MaterialCardView / MaterialButton / Bottom App Bars / ExtendedFloatingActionButton / appcompat / recyclerview / constraintlayout
- Square [Retrofit] / [Okhttp] / [Logging-Interceptor]
- [Glide]: An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling
- [Lottie-Android]: Render After Effects animations natively on Android
- [MaterialSearchView]: Cute library to implement SearchView in a Material Design Approach
- [MPAndroidChart]: A powerful & easy to use chart library for Android
- [Dagger Hilt]: Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project
- [Kotlin coroutines]: A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [StateFlow]: StateFlow and SharedFlow are Flow APIs that enable flows to optimally emit state updates and emit values to multiple consumers.
