# CountryWeather
Weatherapp is a simple weather forecast app, which uses some APIs to fetch 5 day / 3 hour forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap and to fetch places,cities,counties,coords etc. from Algolia Places. The main goal of this app is to be a sample of how to build an high quality Android application that uses the Architecture components, Dagger etc. in Kotlin.
